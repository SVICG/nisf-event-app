## Required Software
Node.js\
npm
IDE (VSCode)

## Servers
Front End Port: http://localhost:3000/
Back End Port: http://localhost:5000/

## Local Setup
- Download Git
- Type npm -v to verify npm installation 
- Clone from git repository 
- Open VSCode and open the cloned repository
- In root directory in terminal type `npm run setup-production` 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
Produces mochawsome report


### `npm run setup-production`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It installs all dependencies and libraries in the root and nisf-event-app client


### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
